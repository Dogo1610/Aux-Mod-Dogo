## Communication System for Deaf Players
Keeli Company does what it can to meet the needs of players because everyone deserves the ability to play. The original system was created by Mithu Ral (`jenenna985` on [Discord](https://discord.com/)), but allows their code to be used freely. This system was then completely rewritten and updated for more functionality and features.

This system is packed together with the [Keeli Company Aux Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2791896289) but is also included as a [separate mod download](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3005504621) for other groups to use freely. You can find the original mod [created by Jenna here](https://github.com/DartRuffian/A3-ChatWheel).
